status-nginx-module
===================
![](https://travis-ci.org/hnlq715/status-nginx-module.svg)

The req status module for pure nginx. The core source file comes from Tengine, which is developed and maintained by Alibaba.

Description
===========

This module will help monitor running status of Nginx.
* It can provide running status information of Nginx.
* The information is divided into different zones, and each zone is independent.
* The status information is about connections, requests, response status codes, input and output flows, rt, and upstreams.
* It shows all the results by default, and can be set to show part of them by specifying zones.

Compilation
===========

```
git clone https://github.com/hnlq715/status-nginx-module
./configure --add-module=/path/to/status-nginx-module
make && make install
```

Example
=======

```
http {
    http_status_zone host "$host,$server_addr:$server_port" 10M;

    server {
        location /us {
            http_status_show;
        }

        http_status host;
    }
}
```

When you call '/us', you will get the results like this:
```
localhost,127.0.0.1:80,162,6242,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,10,1,10,1
```
